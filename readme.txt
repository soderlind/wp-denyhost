WP-DenyHost denies a spammer from accessing your WordPress blog

== Description ==

Based on a users IP address, WP-DenyHost will block a spammer if he already has been tagged as a spammer. Use it together with the Akismet plugin. Akismet tags the spammer, and WP-DenyHost prevents him from accessing you site.

If you have a [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) account, the plugin can add spamers to [CloudFlare Block list](https://www.cloudflare.com/threat-control)

== Installation ==

= Manual Installation =
* Upload the files to wp-content/plugins/wp-denyhost/
* Activate the plugin

= Automatic Installation =
* On your WordPress blog, open the Dashboard
* Go to Plugins->Install New
* Search for "wp-denyhost"
* Click on install to install WP-DenyHost

= Configuration =
In Settings -> WP-DenyHost, set the threshold and response. Default threshold is 3, default response is 403 Forbidden.

If you have a [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) account, you can enable CloudFlare and spammers will be added to the [CloudFlare Block list](https://www.cloudflare.com/threat-control)
